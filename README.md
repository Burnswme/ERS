# ERS
An Employee Reimbursement System I developed using a Java Backend and a Javascript Frontend
This project requires Java 1.8 or higher and either a Weblogic server or similar 
server for the frontend as well as a database (preferably Oracle, but an Amazon RDS or similar backend will do) in order to work.
